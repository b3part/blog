# Thought For Food

Steps for creating a new blog:
```
> Go to content/articles folder
> Now click on Add file dropdown and select "create new file"
> Write the name of your file. it should have the extension ".md"
> Start your blog with these three lines:
  ---
  title: "title_of_your_blog"
  date: "2020-07-26"
  type: "article"
  ---
> after typing the above block leave a line and write your entire blog in markdown
> once you are done, click on "Commit new file"
> wait for a minute or two, you will be able to see your blog on the site
```

Steps for editing the About page:
```
> Go to content folder. There is a file called about.md
> Open the file and click on edit
> Write the about me in markdown format
> once you are done click on "commit changes"
> wait for a minute or two, you will be able to see your updated about me page
```

After the welcome on the main page, you can add a small intro as well.
To do that follow these steps:\
```
> go to the file layouts/index.html
> there you will find "<strong>Thought For Food</strong>"
> you can start adding just after that.
For eg:
<strong>Thought For Food</strong> is a blog which I will use to express blah blah blah
<p> blah blah blah </p>
<p> blah blah blah </p>
```
