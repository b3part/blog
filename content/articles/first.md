I don't feel like reading anymore. I've read enough to know that I don't want to do it anymore just for the sake of winning an argument or having a debate or proving a point. I've surpassed the need of reading to satisfy my conscience for being 'aware'.

When I read War and Peace, I came to analyze the philosophy behind interpreting the execution of events (something we colloquially call history). One of the main premises of the book is that the more you rise in ranks, the more you lose your control over what's happening on the ground. You get tied in rules and protocols, and become less likely to bring any change. To bring revolution, you need to be out there - in the battlefield. 

I know it sounds counterintuitive. That we have been told otherwise. But it's the soldiers who decide the fate of the war, and not the commander-in-chief - as opposed to common perception.

I agree with this line of thought, and would very much like to live by it. But I can't. And it makes me frustrated. I feel the hypocrisy weighing down on me, when I'm not able to live by the text I appreciate, and I feel that I would've been better off had I not known it in the first place. It makes me confront my helplessness. 

It's easy to be educated. The tough part is acting like it.
