Through the closed window
I see the moving leaves
The dancing branches
I see the breeze
But don't feel it

The summer is here
With calm afternoons
Chirp of warmth 
Consuming the silence winter left behind

Days last long
Weeks vanish in a blink

Seasons pass
And I keep staring

Hoping I could care more.
